# Web Portfolio 

Welcome to my web portfolio! I'm a web developer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at UNSW. During my time in university, I developed a strong passion for frontend web development. I had the opportunity to work on many personal and team projects involving web design and development.

I'm particularly interested in creating user-friendly and visually captivating web apps that provide a great user experience. I believe that good frontend design is essential for making software that people geninuely love to use.

In this portfolio, you'll find a collection of my recent projects that showcase my proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other technologies. I'm constantly learning and broadening my skillset to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the web development industry.
